 # Poliana Instructions

## Onject of the Game

The Object of the Game is to advance all (4x) Pawns in your Team Color (Red|Green|Blue|Yellow) from their starting place in their Color-specific Jail, counter-clockwise around the Board, to their Color-specific Home.

The first Player to do so is the Winner.

## General

### First Principles

* The Game is designed for (4x) Players, but can be played with fewer.
* If there are (2x) Players, they should sit on opposite sides of the Board from one another, playing as the corresponding Colors on their side of the Board.
* Play always starts with the oldest Player, and moves clockwise from there.

### Dice Principles

* On each Turn, a Player rolls two Dice, then advances (only their own) Pawns accordingly.
* The Dice must land in the Dice Pit at the center of the Board, and each Die must bounce off the Dice Pit sidewalls at least
once before coming to rest.

#### Dividing and Combining Rolls

* The number rolled on a single Die gives the *exact* amount of Spaces (no more, no less) that a Pawn may advance forward.
* Any number rolled on a single Die *cannot* be split between more than one Pawn.
* Each of the (2x) numbers rolled by the Dice on a turn can be used to advance the same Pawn in the same Turn twice, but strictly as one Move immediately following the other.

#### Forfeiting a Roll

* Any number rolled on a single Die that can't be advanced for the exact amount, by any of Player's Pawns, must be Forfeited. (This is known as an "Involuntary Forfeit").
* In addition: any number rolled on a single Die *can* be Forfeited at any time, for any reason. (This is known as an "Voluntary Forfeit").
* A player *cannot* take (2x) consecutive Turns in which they Voluntarily Forfeit all of their Moves.
* However, note that the "consecutive Forfeits" rule does *not* apply to a player taking Turns with any Involuntary Forfeits at all. (If the Player can't move at all, nothing can be done about it by the Player at the time of the Move.)

### Doubles (Special Case) 

* In the case of rolling Doubles, it is just as if the Player gets an entire extra Turn, immediately after their current Turn is done. (All other rules governing Dice still apply).
* Multiple Double Rolls can be made by a single Player. There is no limit to the amount of extra Turns can be received this way.

### Breaking out of Jail (Special Case)

* As mentioned in the prior section "Object of the Game", all Pawns start in their Color-specific Jail. The only way for a player to "Break out of Jail" is to roll exactly [6] on a single Die. (This will be discussed further in the Section "Theory of Play").

## Theory of Play

### Overall Flow

* All Pawns start in their Color-corresponding Jail.
* Each Pawn must "Break Out of Jail" by rolling exactly [6] on a single Die.
* Each Break Out advances that Pawn to "Square 0" just outside their Jail. Only on the next Turn, can that Pawn advance any further. (This is true, even if there is still a single Die throw left to use as part of the current Turn).
* Each Pawn must travel counterclockwise down the Hallway.
* Optionally, any Pawn may travel over any Catwalk (and not just the one on their side of the Board) as they advance.
* For the duration of a Pawn's time on the Hallway or Catwalk, it can Capture enemy Pawns by landing directly on them. This sends the Captured Pawn back to its own Jail.
* For the duration of a Pawn's time on the Hallway (but *not* on the Catwalk). A Pawn can "Stack" with any number of Pawns of the same Color, on a single Space. This makes all of the Stacked Pawns unable to be Captured, for as lomg as they are Stacked.
* At the "Square 9" corresponding to Team Color, each Pawn advamces to their Team's Stairway without having to stop for any reason (such as having to roll some precise number). 
* To reach the Exit at the top of the Stairway, the exact Die amount to reach the Exit Space (and no more) must be rolled.
* Once all (4x) of a Player's Pawns are in Exit, that Player wins the Game.

### Starting Positions

* Each team of (4x) Pawns starts in the Jail that corresponds to its Team Color (Red|Green|Blue|Yellow).

### Jail

* The entire Jail (approx. (4x) normal-sized Spaces) is treated as a single Space. Therefore, all Pawns of any Color start in the same Space at the Start of the Game.
* Only Pawns of the corresponding Color can be in a Jail. (There is *no* situation where Pawns will ever be in a Jail of another Color).

#### Breaking Out of Jail

* On any single Die roll of exactly [6], a single Pawn may Break Out of Jail.
* However, Player is *not* required to Break Out a Pawn, just because a [6] is rolled on a single Die, and there is at least (1x) Pawn in Player's Jail.
* The act of *not* Breaking Out, when there is the possibility to, counts as a Voluntary Forfeit.
* After the single Die roll of [6] is thrown, the Pawn is moved directly to the "Square 0" right outside their own Jail.
* Pawn may *not* advance at all for the rest of the Move, even if the other Die throw hasn't been used yet.

##### Special Capture/Stack Scenarios

* If (1x) enemy Pawn is on Player's "Square 0", and Player Breaks Out a Pawn onto that "Square 0", the enemy Pawn is Captured (see later section "Hallway/Combat/Capturing" for full details). 
* If (1x) or more friendly Pawns are on Player's "Square 0", and Player Breaks Out a Pawn onto that "Square 0", the same Color Pawn(s) are Stacked with, on "Square 0".
* If (2x) or enemy Pawns are on Player's "Square 0", then Player cannot Break Out. (Also, if Breaking Out is Player's only option to make a Move at that time, then the Move is counted as an Involuntary Forfeit.)

##### Special "Double [6]" Scenario

* If Player rolls "Double [6]", they can (for instance) Break Out (2x) Pawns.
* However, it would *not* be possible to Break Out a single Pawn, and then move that single Pawn off of "Square 0" in the same Turn.
* Since rolling Doubles grants a completely additional Turn to the Player, the Dice rolls from the second Turn to advance the Pawn.
