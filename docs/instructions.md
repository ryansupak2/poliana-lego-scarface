# Poliana Instructions

## Onject of the Game

The Object of the Game is to advance all (4x) Pawns in your Team Color (Red|Green|Blue|Yellow) from their starting place in their Color-specific Jail, counter-clockwise around the Board, to their Color-specific Home.

The first Player to do so is the Winner.

## General

### First Principles

* The Game is designed for (4x) Players, but can be played with fewer.
* If there are (2x) Players, they should sit on opposite sides of the Board from one another.
* Play always starts with the oldest Player, and moves clockwise from there.

### Dice Principles

* On each Turn, a Player rolls two Dice, then advances (only their own) Pawns accordingly.
* The Dice must land in the Dice Pit at the center of the Board, and each Die must bounce off the Dice Pit sidewalls at least
once before coming to rest.

#### Dividing Rolls

* The number rolled on a single Die gives the *exact* amount of Spaces (no more, no less) that a Pawn may advance forward.
* Any number rolled on a single Die *cannot* be split between more than one Pawn.
* Each of the (2x) numbers rolled by the Dice on a turn can be used to Move the same Pawn in the same Turn twice, one Move immediately following the other.

#### Forfeiting a Roll

* Any number rolled on a single Die that can't be executed at the exact amount by any of Player's Pawns, must be Forfeited.
* In addition: any number rolled on a single Die *can* be Forfeited at any time, for any reason.

### Doubles (Special Case) 

* In the case of rolling Doubles, it is just as if the Player gets an entire extra Turn, immediately after their current Turn is done. (All other rules governing Dice still apply).
* Multiple Double Rolls can be made by a single Player. There is no limit to the amount of extra Turns can be received this way.

### Breaking out of Jail (Special Case)

* As mentioned in the prior section "Objevt of the Game", all Pawns start in their color-specific Jail. The only way for a player to "Break out of Jail" is to roll exactly [6] on a Die.

## Theory of Play

* Each team of (4x) Pawns starts in the Jail that corresponds to its Team Color (Red|Green|Blue|Yellow).
* On a Dice roll of [6] (each dice
